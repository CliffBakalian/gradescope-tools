# Gradescope Tools Grading Interface

I wanted an interactive REPL for doing grades. So I made one. 

## List of commands

+ courses - lists the courses
+ select <courseID> - will run fture commands with the selected course ID
+ get assignments [courseID] - lists all the assignments for a particular course
+ grade <assignmentID> [courseID] - will produce a grade file for the given assignment
+ [exit|quit] - exit or quit the REPL
