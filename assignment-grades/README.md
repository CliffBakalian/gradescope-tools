# assignment-grades

This is a tool to download grades for assignments on gradescope. 
Then it will create a file to upload grades to canvas because gradescope
change grades due to extensions, late penalties, etc. In particular I 
allow students to have extension tokens they can use for homeworks 
throughout the semester and gradescope doesn't have that dynamic extension
functionality.  

This is a go version and modification of my old colleague Vinnie's work: [https://github.com/vcapra1/ta-toolbox][https://github.com/vcapra1/ta-toolbox] 
since I now teach other classes that need a more generic version or different extension policies.
