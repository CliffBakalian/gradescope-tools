# Gradescope Grading Stats

#installation 

you can install this by running `go install github.com/cliffbakalian/gradescope-tools/grading-stats`

## Running the program
I would suggest running the program in interactive mode:
```
grading-stats -interactive
```

### Default Mode

The default mode requires you pass in information via command line arguments  
I currently have issues with taking in the password as a command line argument (great for scripting but otherwise such a security risk) if the password has certain special characters in it. If it fails to take your password, please run in interactive mode 

Gradescope urls look like https://www.gradescope.com/courses/XXXXX/assignments/YYYYYYY/ where XXXXXX is the course id and YYYYYYY is the assignment id.

So to get the stats of a particular assignment you could run 
```
grading-stats -course XXXXXX -assignment YYYYYYY -email cliffbakalian@gmail.com -password password123
```

### Interactive Mode

Alternatively you can run 
```
grading-stats -interactive
```
for the program to prompt you for all information
