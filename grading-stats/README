# Gradescope Grading Stats

#installation 

## Running the program
you can run the program with  
```
go run main.go -interactive
```

### Default Mode

The default mode requires you pass in information via command line arguments  
I currently have issues with taking in the password as a command line argument (gret for scripting but otherwise such a security risk) so you can only feed in a course id, an assignment id and the login email.

Gradescope urls look like https://www.gradescope.com/courses/XXXXX/assignments/YYYYYYY/ where XXXXXX is the course id and YYYYYYY is the assignment id.

So to get the stats of a particular assignment you could run 
```
go run main.go -course XXXXXX -assignment YYYYYYY -email cliffbakalian@gmail.com
```

if you wanted to try and put your password in you can 
  + comment line 19 in main.go
  + comment lines 136 and 148 in gradescope/gradescope.go
  + uncomment lines 14 and 18 in main.go
  + uncomment lines 135 and 146 in gradescope/gradescope.go
Then run 
```
go run main.go -course XXXXXX -assignment YYYYYYY -email cliffbakalian@gmail.com -password ZZZZZZZ
```

### Interactive Mode

Alternatively you can run 
```
go run main.go -interactive
```
for the program to prompt you for all information
